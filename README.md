# IPomg

Find your IP address and approximate geolocation with this static site and free API.

My goal with this project was to try out TailwindCSS (which exploded in popularity over the past couple of years) and also Maxmind's free GeoLite2 geolocation database.
\
\
The code for the front-end is here in this repository and the code for the API is in a separate private repository because of MaxMind's licensing rules regarding the use of their databases. (Not allowed to share it with people - you have to sign up separately for a MaxMind account on your own.)
